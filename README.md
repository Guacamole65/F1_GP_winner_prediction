# F1_GP_winner_prediction
I/- Machine Learning project to predict the winner of an F1 GP :

The main objective of this model is going to be to predict the winner of a Formula 1 Grand-Prix, looking at historical data of the circuit and driver/team data. 

II/- Roadmap : 

Phase 1 : Looking at the broader picture, assembling all of the tools needed and searching for datasets.

Phase 2 : Collecting the data, preparing it and understanding the structure of the data.

Phase 3 : Clean the data, run essential metrics to test the reliability and quality of the dataset fetched. 

Phase 4 : Training the model with our cleaned data.

Phase 5 : Testing our model on our test dataset and assessing its performance using key metrics.

Phase 6 : Final touches to the model to improve the overall quality and computational efficiency of  the code.

Note : I'm aware that the current version of my code is quite unreliable since the accuracy of the model is around 30-40%. This is because I used very simple/basic metrics to predict the position of the top 3 drivers. To have better accuracy, I'll add important features that seems a bit more 'niche' like grid position advantage. Another factor on which I can try and gain accuracy is the classifier used, switching to XGBoost or GradientBoosting.
